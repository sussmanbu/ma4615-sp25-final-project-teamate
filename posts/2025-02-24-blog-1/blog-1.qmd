**Data #1:**
URL: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HLO4XC

The data comes from Kline, Patrick, Evan K. Rose, and Christopher
R. Walters, "Systemic Discrimination Among Large U.S. Employers,"
The Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 137 no. 4, (2022),
1963-2036.https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac024. This dataset, published
alongside the article by Kline, Rose, and Walters (2022), examines potential
systemic hiring discrimination by large U.S. employers. The data primarily
cover hiring outcomes, employer characteristics, and applicant demographic
details spanning several years. Data is originally collected by authors. They
conducted a randomized control trail (RCT) to identify patterns of potential
discrimination, estimating the magnitude of these effects, and understanding
whether certain employer or regional characteristics are associated with
differential outcomes.
