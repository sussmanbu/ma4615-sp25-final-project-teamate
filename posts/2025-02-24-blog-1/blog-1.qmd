**Data #1:**
URL: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HLO4XC

The data comes from Kline, Patrick, Evan K. Rose, and Christopher
R. Walters, "Systemic Discrimination Among Large U.S. Employers,"
The Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 137 no. 4, (2022),
1963-2036.https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac024. This dataset, published
alongside the article by Kline, Rose, and Walters (2022), examines potential
systemic hiring discrimination by large U.S. employers. The data primarily
cover hiring outcomes, employer characteristics, and applicant demographic
details spanning several years. Data is originally collected by authors. They
conducted a randomized control trail (RCT) to identify patterns of potential
discrimination, estimating the magnitude of these effects, and understanding
whether certain employer or regional characteristics are associated with
differential outcomes.

**Data #2:**

The dataset described in College-Level Data for 139 Selective American Colleges provides insights into college application and attendance patterns among U.S. students based on parental income. Compiled by linking standardized test-takers (SAT or ACT from 2011, 2013, or 2015) to tax data, this dataset categorizes students into income bins to analyze disparities in college access. It covers 139 selective colleges, including Ivy-Plus institutions, elite private colleges, and flagship public universities. The dataset includes key metrics such as relative application rates, attendance rates, and conditional attendance rates, allowing researchers to examine how income influences higher education opportunities.

A challenge in working with this dataset is its reliance on estimated values, as noise has been added for privacy reasons, potentially affecting precision. Additionally, while the dataset is rich in application and attendance statistics, it does not include direct measures of student academic performance beyond standardized test scores, limiting deeper analysis of post-admission outcomes.
